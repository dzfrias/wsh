# Disabling this test on Windows because I'm not sure what to do. In the CI, the test fails as a
# result of:
#   echo: write error: Bad file descriptor
# I found a good issue (https://github.com/mvdan/sh/issues/289) that has a pretty long-standing
# investigation of this behavior. I do not have a Windows machine to thoroughly debug this on, so
# I'm going to leave the append redirect test disabled for now.
#
# In the issue, it was suggested that bash emulates /dev/fd on Windows, which is interesting.
# However, work at such a low-level is not feasible, as I don't have Windows. Working entirely
# through GitHub Actions would be impractical for this task.
