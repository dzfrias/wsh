# Introduction

> This book is **not** complete, so do not expect all chapters to be finished.

`wsh` is the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)-based shell, bringing the
power of Wasm to the everyday programmer! This shell aims to be a comfortable
experience to those familiar with traditional shell languages, but provides a
powerful toolkit for interacting with programs in ways impossible before the
days of WebAssembly.

If you'd like a quick overview of _what_ `wsh` allows you to do (and why), see
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dzfrias/wsh). `wsh` is compatible
with **all** major operating systems and architectures.
